                A traineeship is a course with work experience that gets you ready for work or an apprenticeship. It can last up to 6 months.<br/>
                You can apply if you’re:
                <ul>
                    <li>eligible to work in England</li>
                    <li>unemployed and have little or no work experience</li>
                    <li>aged 16 to 24 and qualified below Level 3</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                You’ll get:
                <ul>
                    <li>a work experience placement</li>
                    <li>help with English and maths (if you need it)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>You won’t be paid, but you may be given expenses for things like travel and meals.</p>
