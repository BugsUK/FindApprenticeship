                Mistakes make employers think you haven’t taken the time to get things
                right. They could be concerned about how you will communicate with
                customers and other organisations.
            </p>
            <p>
                If spelling and grammar aren’t your strong points, ask someone who’s
                good with words to check your application. Our advisers can also
                tell you how to improve your writing.

                Employers will be impressed if your application seems carefully considered,
                and if you’ve made an effort to understand the role and what’s

            <p>
                You can create this impression by applying for fewer jobs but taking
                the time to make sure each application is tailored to an organisation
                and role.
